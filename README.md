## 📜 About

The **Caesar Cipher** is one of the oldest encryption techniques. It works by shifting each letter in the message by a fixed number of places in the alphabet.

This Python program:
- Encodes or decodes messages
- Accepts custom shift amounts
- Handles non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) gracefully
- Loops until the user chooses to exit
